      "Here, we present the Precision Medicine Knowledge Graph (PrimeKG). This resource provides a holistic view of diseases. We have integrated 20 high-quality datasets, biorepositories and ontologies to curate this knowledge graph. PrimeKG systematically captures information about 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing various major biological scales, including diseases, drugs, genes, proteins, exposures, phenotypes, drug side effects, molecular functions, cellular components, biological processes, anatomical regions, and pathways. Disease nodes in our multi-relational knowledge graph are densely connected to every other node type. PrimeKG's rich graph structure is supplemented with textual descriptions of clinical guidelines for drug and disease nodes to enable multi-modal disease exploration. For further details, please read our publication cited below. To get started with using PrimeKG, please explore the tutorial shared on our GitHub repository: https://githu\n",

Sometimes the fractures happen for no known reason. oi can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. oi is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly. When these genes don't work, it affects how you make collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong. OI can range from mild to severe, and symptoms vary from person to person.

Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones.

Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones.

Sometimes the fractures happen for no known reason. oi can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. oi is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly.

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when...   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when...   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.   \n",

If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children.   \n",

For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.   \n",

      "369  A rare neoplasm arising from the ovary. Although it may occur at any age, it is more often seen in young females. Morphologically, it is characterized by a mixture of two cellular populations: well differentiated Sertoli cells and granulosa cells, with the latter constituting at least ten percent of the neoplasm. The vast majority of cases are stage I lesions at presentation and produce either estrogenic or androgenic manifestations. Although it may present as a massive ovarian tumor, it usually follows a benign clinical course. Very rare case reports of testicular lesions morphologically resembling gynandroblastomas are in fact variants of juvenile granulose cell tumor, or Sertoli cell tumor, or a combination of both.   \n",
